# Project considerations

Firstly, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to carry out this test.
I was very happy to be able to do it, as it was an interesting challenge, I hope to meet expectations.

## Available Scripts

In this project you will need to run:

### `npm install`

Running this code in the project's home folder through the terminal, it will download 'node_modules' and some dependencies necessary to start the project.

### `npm run dev`

By running this code you will enter developer mode and be able to see and edit the project.
It will open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) and with that you will see the content.

The page will reload every time there are changes in the project, whether in the structure or styling.
If there are errors you will be able to see them in the terminal console.
